# Web-Scraping
Web scraping using Beautiful Soup, Openpyxl and Pandas

Web Scraping is the process of extracting data from a website.
Beautiful Soup is a python library for pulling out of HTML files.
before starting you need to install requests, bs4, html5lib, pandas and openpyxl using pip command.
like pip install requests.
After extracting the data, to save the data in a file, I use openpyxl and pandas both to save the data.
