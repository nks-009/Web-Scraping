Web scraping using Beautiful Soup and Openpyxl

Web Scraping is the process of extracting data from a website.
Beautiful Soup is a python library for pulling out of HTML files.
before starting you need to install requests, bs4, html5lib and openpyxl using pip command.
like pip install requests
After extracting the data, to save the data in a file, I use openpyxl to save the data in excel.
